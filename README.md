# Air-Quality-Monitoring-System
This project focused on developing and deploying an IoT-based Air Quality Monitoring 
Node to measure and analyse key environmental parameters such as PM2.5, PM10, 
temperature, and humidity. The system was designed using an ESP32 microcontroller, 
SDS011 particulate sensor, and AHT10 temperature & humidity sensor. The monitoring 
node was deployed at a strategic campus location, where it collected real-time data over a 
period of 3 days. The collected data was processed and analysed to identify trends, 
variations, and environmental influences on air quality. The project aimed to enhance 
awareness of air pollution and demonstrate the practical application of IoT in environmental 
monitoring.
